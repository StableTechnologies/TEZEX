Tezex is a non-custodial, permissionless, decentralized exchange for XTZ and Tezos FA-standard tokens (FA-1.2, FA-2.0, etc.), as well as a cross-chain bridge between Tezos assets and assets of other blockchains (Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.)

Tezex liquidity providers are called 'Changemakers', who operate the 'changemaker nodes' which facilitate swaps with the requesting parties.
